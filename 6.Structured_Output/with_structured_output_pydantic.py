This is, hands down, the worst excuse for a guitar I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. The quality is beyond pathetic ,whoever manufactured this clearly has zero knowledge about how a guitar is actually made. The fretboard and string distance are completely messed up, making it unplayable. It‚Äôs like they just randomly slapped some wood and strings together and called it a ‚Äúguitar.‚Äù

To make things worse, the bridge literally broke within 15-20 days. Imagine spending your hard-earned money just to watch your instrument self-destruct like a cheap toy. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This isn‚Äôt just bad , it‚Äôs a straight-up scam.

DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH. Seriously, even if you are a beginner, stay far away. You‚Äôll just waste your money and end up hating the guitar because of this garbage. Instead, go to a local music shop, where you can get a decent beginner guitar starting at around ‚Çπ3000.

To the so-called ‚Äúmanufacturers‚Äù:
If you don‚Äôt know the basic science of fret spacing or how to make a stable bridge,maybe stick to making chopping boards instead of ruining music.

Avoid this disaster at all costs.save yourself from headache and buy a proper instrument locally.this isn't just
A guitar,it's firewood with strings.
